# zed-mdx
MDX language server support for Zed. 

Uses [tree-sitter-mdx](https://github.com/jlopezcur/tree-sitter-mdx) for syntax highlighting, and the queries in this repo are largely copied from that repo with some modifications to support frontmatter. 

Currently work in progress - LSP works ish, syntax highlighting does something but not good at all. notes.md in this repo has todos before this is ready to PR into the extensions repo.
